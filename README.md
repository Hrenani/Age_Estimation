 Age Estimation from Facial Images

## Problem Statement
Estimating a person's age from facial images is a complex task due to the variability in facial features caused by racial differences, makeup, lifestyle, and other factors. The goal of this project is to develop a robust deep learning model capable of accurately estimating age from facial images, regardless of these variations.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. **Train a Neural Network**: Develop and train a neural network using PyTorch to estimate age from facial images.
2. **Robustness to Lighting and Quality**: Ensure that the model is resilient to different lighting conditions and low-quality images.
3. **Robustness to Racial and Ethnic Differences**: Minimize the impact of racial, ethnic, and other demographic differences on age estimation accuracy.

## Methodology
Several approaches have been previously explored for this task, including:

1. **Regression with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: This method involves predicting the exact age as a continuous value using CNNs.
2. **Classification with CNNs**: This approach classifies the age into predefined age groups instead of predicting the exact age.
3. **Developing a Custom Library**: A more complex and customized approach, which involves creating a dedicated library for age estimation.
4. **Using miVolo Architecture**: An advanced approach that could potentially extend beyond facial features to include hands, hair, and other body parts for age estimation.

Given the complexity and the constraints of time and hardware, I decided to use the first method: **Regression with CNNs**. The third approach was deemed too complex to complete within the project timeframe, and although the fourth method was intriguing, it was not feasible under the given constraints.

## Dataset
For this project, the **UTKFace** dataset will be used, which provides a large set of facial images labeled with the corresponding age, gender, and ethnicity.
